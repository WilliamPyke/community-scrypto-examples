//! An on-ledger append-only database for recording the evolution of
//! digital documents.
//!
//! Such a database can be useful for publishing the existence of new
//! editions of documents, for proving that a particular document
//! existed at a certain date, etc.
//!
//! Choosing a ledger-based application for this (rather than, for
//! example, an *actual* append-only database) provides a readily
//! available solution (anyone can use the ledger, and it's reachable
//! from anywhere) and one that can clearly be trusted to not cheat
//! with its contents. This drastically reduces the barrier of entry
//! as compared to contracting with traditional online database
//! suppliers for the same type of service.
//!
//! Note that this blueprint does not store the documents themselves,
//! it only stores information about the existence of the documents:
//! The ledger is not a suitable place for general file storage, and
//! it is recommended that the information you store here about each
//! document is kept as small as possible.
//!
//! # Public interface
//!
//! These are the methods exposed by the blueprint to the outside
//! world:
//!
//! - [new] Creates a new indexer instance. Can be called by anyone.
//!
//! - [add_document] Creates a new document index. Can ony be called
//! by authorized users.
//!
//! - [register_document_edition] Adds an edition for a document. Can
//! only be called by authorized users.
//!
//! - [organization] Returns the organization name of the indexer. Can
//! be called by anyone.
//!
//! - [edition_count] Returns the number of editions for a
//! document. Can be called by anyone.
//!
//! - [editions] Returns detailed edition info for a document. Can be
//! called by anyone.
//!
//! - [add_funds] Adds funding to the subsidy mechanism. Can be called
//! by anyone.
//!
//! - [remove_funds] Removes subsidy funding. Can only be called by
//! admins.
//!
//! ## A typical call sequence
//!
//! 1. Alice creates user and admin badges using general ledger tools.
//! 2. Alice creates a new indexer by calling [new] and gives Bob a user badge.
//! 3. Alice calls [add_funds] to provide funding for her users.
//! 4. Bob calls [add_document] to create an (empty) index for a new document.
//! 5. Bob calls [register_document_edition] to register the initial
//! version for that document.
//! 6. Bob (and other users) keep calling [register_document_edition]
//! for the document as it evolves.
//! 7. Any number of additional documents could be created and tracked
//! in the same manner.
//!
//! Throughout, anyone may be calling [editions] and [edition_count]
//! to follow the development of a document.
//!
//! # About digital hashes
//!
//! This blueprint (the indexer) presumes the use of a strong hash
//! function to identify each edition of a document. The exact use of
//! this hash function is outside the scope of the blueprint as it
//! never actually handles the document itself. It is expected that
//! users will employ some tool that produces hashes for their
//! documents, and this is then the hash that they upload to the
//! indexer.
//!
//! As an example, on Linux you can use the `sha256sum` tool to
//! compute a strong cryptographic hash for a document. Here it is,
//! used on the Bitcoin whitepaper:
//! ```text
//! $ sha256sum -b Bitcoin_whitepaper.pdf 
//! 4488b60b08c7d548162418148b3dbd794b27f441024a338fad3e25fed4a74057 *Bitcoin_whitepaper.pdf
//! ```
//!
//! So if you were to register the Bitcoin whitepaper with the
//! indexer, then that's the hash you might use.
//!
//! The blueprint itself will put no actual requirements on you as to
//! which hash function to use, or how to use it. That is your own
//! decision based on your own security needs. SHA256 is pretty good
//! though and it's *right there* is all I'm saying.
//!
//! # About user roles
//!
//! The blueprint has three distinct user roles.
//!
//! The Owner is final arbiter of all administrative decisions.
//!
//! The Admins have the power to remove funds from the component.
//!
//! The Users are able to add documents and register new editions of
//! such.
//!
//! Some may wish to allow only Admins to call the [add_document]
//! method. In this case, simply change it from `restrict_to: [user]`
//! to `restrict_to: [admin]`. Or if you want both users *and* admins
//! to be able to use it, change it to `restrict_to: [user, admin]`.
//!
//! # About funding and subsidies
//!
//! If you are using this blueprint for professional purposes then you
//! may be in a situation where your actual users---or even their
//! organization---don't want to have to think about the decentralized
//! ledger at all while using your software. To them, the fact that
//! your indexer runs on the ledger is a boring implementation detail
//! and they fell asleep two words into your explanation. They don't
//! want to know about the ledger, don't want to have to deal with the
//! ledger, and certainly have no interest in keeping track of gas
//! costs for adding document registrations.
//!
//! To support this type of use case we provide a subsidy function
//! which enables you to add a pile of XRD to your indexer instance
//! and this pile will then be paying the transaction costs of your
//! users when they add documents and document editions. They can run
//! their daily operations without caring about XRD balances, and
//! someone else can keep an eye on the subsidy account and top it up
//! if necessary. Note that there must be at least 10 XRD in the
//! component for subsidies to be active.
//!
//! Any user account that wants to make use of the subsidy must have a
//! small amount of XRD in that account, simply as collateral for the
//! ledger until transaction execution reaches the point where subsidy
//! is established. Generally speaking, and at current cost levels, 1
//! XRD should be sufficient for this.
//!
//! The current subsidy implementation uses the `lock_fee` method
//! which means that we end up subsidizing failed transactions. This
//! is exactly what you might want for when you have a contractually
//! regulated professional relationship with your users: You don't
//! expect such users to be deliberately spamming failing transactions
//! just to troll you, and if there is an abundance of failed
//! transactions then it's probably a training issue or at worst
//! something to bring up during your next contract negotations.
//!
//! If instead of this your user base is random internet trolls then
//! primarily we recommend not subsidizing them at all but if you
//! *must* do so then you may want to switch the implementation over
//! to using `lock_contingent_fee` to remove at least the most obvious
//! attack vector on your subsidy funds. Also you may want to reduce
//! the subsidy from the current very generous 10 XRD to something
//! much closer to the expected actual transaction cost of the call.
//!
//! Note that when this component subsidizes a call with 10 XRD, those
//! 10 XRD go towards covering not only the processing in this
//! component but also any other processing that happens in the
//! enclosing transaction manifest. So long as you have trustworthy
//! users who just run transaction manifests exactly as they are built
//! by your own front-end this isn't a problem, but if you have more
//! enterprising and opportunistic users then they may change those
//! transaction manifests to include other expensive calls of their
//! own which you are then paying for. Again, our advice is to only
//! subsidize users you can trust or else to reduce the subsidy amount
//! from 10 XRD down to the actual cost of the method being called
//! (calculating this lower cost is left as an exercise for the
//! reader).
//!
//! # Use Cases
//!
//! This blueprint primarily provides a means of documenting the
//! existence of digital documents. While it also allows you to
//! register other metadata about each document (as `attributes`) the
//! main points of interest are the following three data fields:
//!
//! - Hash value
//! - Registration timestamp
//! - Identity of user making the registration
//!
//! The hash value, if used with proper care, uniquely identifies your
//! document among all documents in existence and as such makes it
//! undisputable which document is covered in this registration. Note
//! that the component doesn't compel anyone to produce the *actual*
//! document at all unless they are in a situation where they need to
//! make that proof: At this point they produce the document, a
//! trusted party computes its hash value, and this result is then
//! compared to the registry on ledger.
//!
//! The timestamp is generated by the ledger and so provides an
//! undisputable time and date at which that document definitely
//! existed.
//!
//! The user identity is determined through the use of ledger-verified
//! badges and so long as the user's keys have been kept secure gives
//! an undisputable record of who was responsible for making this
//! registration.
//!
//! (Note that as the contents of the accompanying `attributes` is
//! entirely user determined, the blueprint can make no claim about
//! the correctness of *that* data. Only the above three claims can be
//! confidently made.)
//!
//! A fourth guarantee made by this blueprint is that a registration
//! can never be deleted or replaced. As such, what you are seeing
//! here is the complete history of registrations ever made. The
//! blueprint logic itself has been designed to be easy to read such
//! that you can assure yourself that this is true, and of course the
//! ledger guarantees that this cannot be compromised *outside* of the
//! blueprint.
//!
//! As such, what we provide is a permanent and unfalsifiable record
//! of registrations each of which can be tied to a unique digital
//! document out there in the world.
//!
//! This has obvious usefulness for such diverse applications as
//!
//! - Publishing official documents
//! - Exposing document flows to be audited by external parties
//! - Supply chain management
//! - Proof of existence at a certain date
//!   - For copyright claims
//!   - For legal documents
//!   - To prove this was not recently AI generated content
//!   - To prove Trotsky was originally in the photograph
//!   - Etc.
//!
//! (Note that while the immutability of the ledger has -- to the
//! author's knowledge -- yet to be fully accepted by the court of
//! law, having this as *one* of your pieces of evidence cannot
//! possibly hurt.)
//!
//! ## Publishing official documents
//!
//! While one might argue that government (and big corporations)
//! should provide their own software solutions for their publishing
//! needs, their eager adoption of services such as Facebook and
//! Twitter for more casual publishing would seem to suggest they are
//! open to basing themselves on solutions provided and controlled by
//! private industry. The open ledger, being controlled by no one and
//! everyone, will with some likelihood become very enticing for
//! governments looking to reduce operating costs while avoiding
//! another billion dollar failed IT project.
//!
//! Additionally, using this blueprint on the open ledger to announce
//! the existence of editions of e.g. laws and regulations would force
//! a level of transparency on governments which in many cases is
//! sorely lacking. There exists a possible future in which e.g.
//! international lending organizations require of countries they lend
//! money to, to adopt exactly this kind of transparent solution for
//! their government work.
//!
//! We can also look towards academia where fraudulent degrees remain
//! a problem. If academic degrees were published in a suitably
//! anonymized fashion---something which this blueprint very much
//! caters to---then it becomes possible for employers to conduct a
//! simple audit of an applicant's credentials; as well as for
//! academic institutions to conduct forensic analysis on them after
//! malfeasance has been discovered. (Some might recall that Cardano
//! pursued a project along these lines a few years back.) As a brief
//! example, if an indexer is known to be run by a given university
//! and the `registering_user` is a professor there then an entry that
//! says "student Alice has earned a doctorate in genetic engineering"
//! makes all of that professor's other on-indexer claims suspect when
//! it is later revealed that Alice knows nothing about genetic
//! engineering whatsoever.
//!
//! ## Exposing document flows to be audited by external parties
//!
//! If you're in a company or a larger project (perhaps a
//! multi-company effort) that produces a lot of technical documents,
//! then it can become an almost impossible task for outside auditors
//! to keep track of and audit all of those documents. In particular
//! if documents are being produced on different sites or by different
//! organizations they can have widely varying practices wrt
//! producing, approving and archiving them, and trying to dig into
//! this can become a bit of a nightmare. This outside auditor could
//! be your ultimate customer, or it could be an external company
//! auditing your ISO9001 compliance, etc.
//!
//! A fairly low effort but high gain requirement in such a situation
//! is to make all participants register any new document or new
//! document edition to a common external service. The auditor then
//! has one single place to look for documents that should exist, and
//! will know exactly what to ask for when digging into any particular
//! aspect of the overall documentation of the project. Also, if a
//! project participant starts presenting documents that *do not*
//! exist in the external index, the auditor knows to put some extra
//! special care into investigating their internal document handling
//! practices. (Such a service is one of the key deliverables of the
//! Triall project, at triall.io)
//!
//! ## Supply chain management
//!
//! When you ship ten thousand gizmos from your factory in Taiwan and
//! somehow only eight thousand made it to warehouses in Europe, you
//! are going to want to start sticking an RFID sticker on each of
//! those gizmos to figure out what's going on with that. Or if you're
//! sending perishables across the country and relying on third
//! parties to keep them cool en route you may want to attach
//! RFID-enabled temperature sensors to them to keep your contractors
//! honest.
//!
//! Those are only two of the myriad of reasons you may want to track
//! the goods you're moving around. And whenever one of those RFIDs
//! gets scanned, the event needs to be stored somewhere. You can use
//! the indexer for this which provides an ever-present and
//! incorruptible source of truth for when you sit down to investigate
//! what's going wrong in your supply chain.
//!
//! Some may recall that VeChain has been very serious about this sort
//! of application.
//!
//! ## Proof of existence at a certain date
//!
//! Since the ledger doesn't lie about the timestamps it sets you can
//! know that whatever document a hash is referring to, that document
//! is at least as old as the date on its registration. This has all
//! sorts of applications.
//!
//! Note that the legal weight of the ledger's inherent
//! trustworthiness is up in the air at the moment, consider the
//! following to be from a bright future in which on-ledger timestamps
//! are considered strong legal evidence.
//!
//! You could write a secret will, register its hash, and later when
//! the full document is revealed it becomes clear that it was written
//! by you (the tx is signed by your account) while you were still
//! sound of mind (proven by the indexer's timestamp). (We need to get
//! soap operas in on this.)
//!
//! You could register a digital work of art (a photo of a painting
//! perhaps, or digital art, a piece of music, a novel, etc.) and use
//! this to defend your copyright claim should it come under attack,
//! the indexer giving you an undisputable timestamp to work
//! with. This might similarly be useful also in trademark or patent
//! disputes.
//!
//! If you have the world's best most ingenious plan and you want to
//! wow your friends with it, you could write it down, register its
//! hash on the indexer, and keep the plan itself secret. And then ten
//! years later when everything played out exactly as you planned it
//! you can reveal the original document and use the registered hash
//! to prove to everyone you're a Mycroft Holmes level strategic
//! genius.
//!
//! # Technical features of note
//!
//! ## Test suite
//!
//! The `tests` directory has a fairly comprehensive test suite that
//! runs through the functionality of the blueprint.
//!
//! ### Transaction manifests
//!
//! Transaction manifests for all publicly exposed methods are built
//! as part of the test suite. Look for the following methds in the
//! `tests/lib.rs` file:
//!
//! | Scrypto function            | Transaction manifest in |
//! |-----------------------------|-------------------------|
//! | [new]                       | `call_new()`
//! | [add_document]              | `build_add_document_manifest()`
//! | [register_document_edition] | `build_register_document_edition_manifest()`
//! | [organization]              | `call_organization()`
//! | [edition_count]             | `call_edition_count()`
//! | [editions]                  | `call_editions()`
//! | [add_funds]                 | `call_add_funds()`
//! | [remove_funds]              | `call_remove_funds()`
//!
//! Note that `add_document` and `register_document_edition` are
//! variously called via `execute_manifest_ignoring_fee` or
//! `execute_manifest`, with the latter used when we're testing the
//! subsidy mechanism. This is because normally we don't want fee
//! deductions to clutter up our tests: they're mostly just noise that
//! we need to expend effort to look past, and at worst they'll make
//! us run out of XRD on bigger tests which is just annoying. We do
//! need fees to be deducted when testing subsidy however because
//! that's how we can check if the fees are being taken from the
//! correct vault.
//!
//! ## Access control
//!
//! We establish system-level access control using our three main
//! roles (owner, admin, user) as well as the PUBLIC role. This
//! provides overall security for the blueprint.
//!
//! Notice however that in addition we also do intent based access
//! control in the [register_document_edition] method. In other words,
//! to call that method you first need to have a suitable proof in
//! your auth zone and *additionally* you need to pass a suitable
//! proof as an argument to the method. (Ideally these two proofs
//! would be proofs of the same badge although technically they don't
//! have to be.) The reason is that in this method we need to log the
//! identity of the user performing the registration and so we need
//! the badge to be passed in. (Notice in the test suite, the manifest
//! built by `build_register_document_edition_manifest()` builds the
//! same proof twice: one is for the auth zone and the other is to
//! pass by intent.)
//!
//! While you might argue that this method could be *only* doing
//! intent based access control (and so we could remove it from
//! system-level access control) it has been kept in both, mostly
//! because using system-level access control gives us fantastic
//! in-code documentation at the start of the component as to how its
//! access control works. (If we were to write there
//! e.g. `register_document_edition => PUBLIC` and then *actually* use
//! intent based access control that effectively equates to
//! `restrict-to: [user]` anyway, the system-level statement of PUBLIC
//! would seem a bit deceptive in the author's opinion.)
//!
//! Note that doing it the way we have, we now have the `user`
//! resource address stored both in component state as `users`, and
//! also in the access rule for the `user` role like this: `user =>
//! rule!(require(users))`. This redundancy is a bit unfortunate as we
//! would prefer for security sensitive information such as this to be
//! stored in a single place only, to avoid confusion. As a practical
//! matter, if we were to implement support for altering the `user`
//! resource address we would have to remember to change it in both
//! places which opens up for making a mistake that causes ambiguity
//! as to what the correct address is.
//!
//! ## KeyValueStore
//!
//! In this blueprint we use the `KeyValueStore` type extensively to
//! enable us to store any amount of data. A Rust programmer's normal
//! inclination might be to use `HashMap` instead but the problem with
//! this is that when first the component initializes it has to load
//! the entirety of its state, which means the entire HashMap. If that
//! HashMap is very big then you can run out into the transaction fee
//! limit before the component is fully loaded, and you will never be
//! able to run anything in your component. The `KeyValueStore` type
//! has been specifically written to provide a map that doesn't have
//! this problem in that its contents isn't loaded until it is
//! requested.
//!
//! In one case what we *really* need is a vector with the lazy-load
//! properties of `KeyValueStore` and we simulate this by putting a
//! KeyValueStore into a struct together with an index counter, see
//! the [Document] struct for this.
//!
//! Also notice that we *do* use a `HashMap` for index entry
//! `attributes`, since we expect this particular map to always be so
//! small as to not have a cost limit problem. (And if you *do* run
//! into this problem you're probably using the indexer for use cases
//! it just wasn't designed for.)
//!
